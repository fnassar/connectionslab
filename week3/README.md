# Project 1 Week 1 brief
## Project Describtion
For this project, I plan on using a high quality world map image on p5. I plan on using p5 to make the image div act like many of the maps we see like google maps for example with the zoom on mouse location at double click, the mouse drag and so on... I found two APIs that I plan on using, the first one is a world cities details. I plan on using p5 to get the lng,lat location relative to the image, and using it as input for the first API to find the city location. The second API I am using is an image search API, where I will take the city and country name from the first API and use it to find a few images for that location and display the images in a slide show style.

## CSS
For the aesthetics of the webpage, I plan on following a similar aesthetic to the one I have used in the previous websites. In a way, I feel the most comfortable with the simple design. I feel like it is easier for the eye and I would kind of like to say it it is a style I am develoving to be my prefered signature thing?
I will only add a title on the page as no navigation will be required for this web*page*, and i will add the images side by side with a p5 sketch which will have the map interaction.

## JavaScript
For the Interactions, 
1. P5: I plan on trying my best to add as many features of online maps *_not including north south and rotation, just navigation_* with adding zoom in and out buttons, zoom on double click, mouse drag to change image location, and hover to show city details at a certain location.
2. JS interactions: For the Images next to the map, i plan on adding a slider with 5 images from an api I have found.

### If Time Allows
I would like to add a pop up feature if I have time *(Like image zoom kind of thing)*, and as much as adding it for image slide show may be simple, I am not sure how p5 will work with that, as it would be ideal in my opinion to pop up the same sketch at the same location and not create a new sketch for the pop up window. Hence for consistency, I will only add this feature if I have time to work with the p5 sketch and make the magic happen.


## Website Link
The current representation of my website is very simple as I am yet to add many steps, p5 was giving me some trouble and it took more time than I expected trying to figure out how to put the sketch inside a div *still trying*.

## Wire frame
the wire frame includes the pop up window part as I feel like it is more user friendly to have an almost full screen map than a small half screen one. I also plan on adding it even if I don't have the time before the deadline for project 1.
