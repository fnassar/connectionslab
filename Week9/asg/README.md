## Project Describtion
Getting an idea for this assignment was near impossible, so I decided to update one we already had. I decided to update the "drawing Website" we already had and make it complete.

## Process
I first started everything with writing down my plan because my head was all over the place.
### planning:

- After finishing the socket and sketch basics, I tried working on adding new brushes.The main problem I faced with that was that the brushes I was going for were all using a certain method of smoothing that required 2 different mouse locations. One that moved with the end of the brush and one for the mouse location which the brush is following. To make the brush strokes similar, one important step was emitting all the changing variables. #note_for_the_future!!
- After testing the brushes I realised it would be nice to allow users to change colors as brushes didn't show much on top on one another. I added a button to randomly choose a different color.
- Then I added a counter for the number of users who are online at a point.

## Next Steps
1. Add an eraser...
2. Add a chat function.
3. Add a method for users to save their names as they go online.
4. Add a reset button to clear screen.
