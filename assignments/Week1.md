# Project Documentation Week 1
## Describtion:
I decided to make a blog for my Intro to Interactive Media Final Project last semester. The blog _(text and image)_ has already been written last semester for final submition so that made it a little easier.

When I was creating the website, I decided to go with the side navigation bar instead of the normal top one. That however, caused me a little problem with the title, as long as the title is on the screen in the middle I cannot add one on the navigation bar where I felt was natural. Therefore, I decided to make the side title apear only as the main page title disapear. 
In addition to the title, I felt as the page is a blog, adding a lot of java script efects did not make sense, so I decided to let it be as it was.

I used a simple gradient for the background and color changes or text size increase on hover to help the user recognize the presence of a hyperlink at said locations.

I started with a simple wireframe https://github.com/fnassar/connectionslab/blob/main/Week1/ProjectDocumentation/Wireframe.jpg that simply describes the website i briefly talked about above.

That being said, here is the link to my simple website.
