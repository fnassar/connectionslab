## Summary
What I have right now is a simple step towards what would be a create your own pallet website for a crayola crayons set that would allow the user to add and remove colors without random selection(*no generate*).

## Design
The wire frame I wanted to do is as follows
**Here is my wire frame**

## Interaction
What i did so far in the website is:
1. I added a dropdown menu to let user choose color

2. I added an option to add upto 5 colors at once from a drop down menu

3. I added a filter to choose the main color for a required shade

## Next Steps
- show color in drop down menu next to the color's name***** IMPORTANT!
- follow wire frame style
  - add an option to remove a color
  - make add color in a grey circle
- remove filter from header and make it look like a shopping websit on top but not in header
- add a drop down menu to download pallet
- maybe create an empty image with pallet as bg gradient
- generally improve aesthetics.
