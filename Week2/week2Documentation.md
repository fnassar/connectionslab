##Inspriation
I had no clue what to do at first. Use and interaction was something I did a lot, yet finding a reason for a website was a struggle. Then I thought about what kind of simple small website would I like to see and use for a simple interaction. I tried to do some research and found some interesting websites, but nothing clicked as what I wanted to do.That's when I remembered all the game nights I had with my family and friends where we never knew which game to play, we did not have the cards and the options were too little. That's why I decided to make a website that has a collection of game nights options online. I do not have that many links for it so i made empty links and left a page for suggestions.

##Design
One of the main go tos people have in game nights is the board games or the playing cards, it's a classic. That's why I chose the dice in the first page and the playing cards in the second page. The playing cards are numbered so it made sense to use them for game options. The background made sense to me as it is similar to the texture of a classic poker table. I know this may not be a poker website, but with the cards and the board games, i thought this background would look nice and help the general aesthetic of the website. I used a free share/use licenced image i found online.
*_What I wrote on the title page may not be the thing you expect to see on a website title page but I was blank, oops_* 
**here is my wire frame**

##Interaction
I used an event on hover for the cards that shows links to different games. 
  I struggled a little with the hover, eventhough I went through it before, I wasn't sure how to make the text stay when the mouse is over the image. The mouse was not over the image when the text apeared however; that's why it did not work, but thank god I remembered.

For the suggestions page, it was all firsts; all the way from the CSS to the html and the js. All I knew was what we did in class, yet surprisingly it was not much of a struggle, eventhough I believe struggles are what makes us remember mistakes.

With that being said, here is the link to my website.
