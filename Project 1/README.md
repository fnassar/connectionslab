## Description

## Production Decisions
* explain wire frame
    * explain division of map up info down
* explain colors

## Inspiration and Thought Process
I first got the map inspiration from Marta's second week project. I saw it and I thought wow this could go far. At the begining I was considering a map that covers the screen with a picture that changes with country location and have information show on hover. 
That however, did not work for 2 main reasons:
1. giving the time frame we had, as I would need to implement my own map from scratch on p5 or using svgs. 
2. I feel like actually envisioning this, finding the right colors and the images changing in the background might not look that good and the picture will not show in whole.

***side Note*** I think it could work but I just couldn't figure it out in the time we had

Then I decided on spliting screen in half as shown in the wire frame bellow. That would have been really hard for the user I think. Having country info, images and map all in one place i think would be too much. 
I also usually prefer simplistic aspects that are easy for the eye and that would not have been.

## Key Challenges and Solutions

## Lessons Learned

## Next Steps
* Add a title page and clean up whole website
* Fix data and units used from API(maybe different sources)
* Add self country and allow user to compare data to other countries
* Present data in a "*Graphic data presentation*"
* allow user to zoom on images (pop up like my main wire frame idea with side by side map)
